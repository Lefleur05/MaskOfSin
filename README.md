## The Game
A wave of enemies attacks you and you must survive as many waves as possible.  
#### Player  
The player can shoot, jump and dash.  
You can choose between 3 masks that have different effects on you.  
* The red mask: when you kill an enemy, it explodes and inflicts damage on nearby enemies.  
* The green mask: increases your speed and allows you to dash twice and climb using your dash.  
* The blue mask: when you shoot and hit something, an explosion freezes nearby enemies for a moment.
